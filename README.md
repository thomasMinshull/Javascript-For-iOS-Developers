# Javascript (ES6) Basics For iOS Developers

> Note: When in doubt, just try something. Chances are the code is going to be the same or similar to swift. <http://i.imgur.com/AwYW1jY.jpg>

## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to introduce the Javascript programming language to iOS developers that are familiar with Swift. Use this to get started with Javascript and come back to this as a reference when you need help.

Make sure you have node installed on your machine, and practice coding in javascript as you read. Enter `node` in terminal on your computer to start the javascript REPL, that  way you can play around with javascript as you read. Think of this as the equivalent of using a playground to try out swift code.


## Variables

Like Swift and Objective-C, Javascript uses variables and constants to store and refer to values.

In modern Javascript, we declare a new variable using one of the following keywords:

* `let` to create a new variable.
* `const` to create a new constant.
* `var` the old way of creating variables. We won't use `var`.


| Javascript | Swift|
| --- | --- |
| `let`  | `var`  |
| `const`  | `let`  |
| `var`  | Doesn't exist in swift |

This can be a little confusing because we're used to `let` being a constant. Just remember that `let` will create a variable, not a constant, in Javascript.

*Swift:*

```swift
var currentTemperature = 14
let hoursInADay = 24
```

*Javascript:*

```js
let currentTemperature = 14;
const hoursInADay = 24;
```


## Types

Types are the kind of variables and constants that we are creating. Strings, Integers, Arrays, etc. We haven't told Javascript what kind of variable we are creating, we just create the variable and assign a value to it. Javascript uses these values to assume what kind of variable you wanted to create. 

```js
let myVariable = 1; // Number
const myConstant = "1"; // String
```

We can check the type of a variable by using the `typeof` operator which returns a string.

```js
console.log(typeof myVariable);
// Prints 'number' to the console
```

> `console.log()` is the equivalent of `print()` in Swift.


This is similar to the way we create variables in swift, but there are two major differences. 

1. In Swift we can specify a type, in Javascript we cannot.
2. In Swift, once a type has been set, it can never be changed. In Javascript, types can change at any time.

### Types can change

JavaScript is a loosely typed or a dynamic language. That means you don't have to declare the type of a variable ahead of time. It also means that you can have the same variable as different types:

*Swift:*

```swift
var greeting :String // greeting is now a string forever
greeting = "Hello, world!" // We can assign any string value to greet
greeting = 10 // Assigning any other value to greeting will cause an error
```

*Javascript:*

```js
let greeting; // greeting is defined but has not type. Actually it's type is 'undefined'
greeting = "Hello, world!" // greeting is now a string with the value "Hello, world!"
greeting = 10 // greeting is now a number with the value 10
greeting = String(greeting) // greeting is now a string with the value "10"
greeting = true;  // greeting is now a Boolean
```

### No explicit types

Every variable in swift has a type weather you specify it or not. If a variable doesn't have a type, your app will not compile.

In Javascript, a variable doesn't have a type until a value is assigned to it, and there is no way to explicitly specify a type without assigning a value.

*Swift:*

```swift
var greeting :String // greeting is now a string type
greeting = "Hello, world!" // We can assign any string value to greet
```

*Javascript:*

```js
let greeting; // greeting is defined but has no type. Actually it's type is 'undefined'
greeting = "Hello, world!" // greeting is now a string with the value "Hello, world!"
```

This can lead to some code that is very scary for someone that is used to type safety:

*Swift:*

```swift
func sum(array: [Int]) -> Int {
    return array.reduce(0) { (resultSoFar, currentNumber) -> Int in
        return resultSoFar + currentNumber
    }
}

print(sum(array: [1, 2, 3, 4]))
```

*Javascript:*

```js
function sum(array) {
  return array.reduce((resultSoFar, currentNumber) => {
    return resultSoFar + currentNumber;
  });
}

console.log(sum([1, 2, 3, 4]));
```

In swift we have to be very explicit about the type of parameters a function can accept, and the type that it returns. Javascript has none of this safety. So in Javascript, we just have to hope that the person calling the function calls it with an array of numbers and expects a number to be returned. But in reality, anything could be passed into or returned from this function in Javascript. There's nothing stopping us from calling the following code:

```js
sum("some string");
```

> Note: Our app would throw an error when this line of code runs. But there would be no issues until it gets called.

Different types in javascript:

* Boolean
* Null
* Undefined
* Number
* String
* Symbol 
* Object

We'll take a look at Numbers, Strings, and Objects.

## Numbers

Javascript doesn't differentiate between the different types of numbers. There's no such thing as an integer or a float in JavaScript, everything's pretty much treated as a 64 bit double.

### Special numbers

The first two are Infinity and -Infinity, which represent the positive and negative infinities. Infinity - 1 is still Infinity, and so on. Don’t put too much trust in infinity-based computation. It isn’t mathematically solid, and it will quickly lead to our next special number: NaN.

NaN stands for “not a number”, even though it is a value of the number type. You’ll get this result when you, for example, try to calculate 0 / 0 (zero divided by zero), Infinity - Infinity, or any number of other numeric operations that don’t yield a precise, meaningful result.

### Operators

Same as swift `+ - * / =`

## String & Interpolation

* In Javascript, you can use both single and double quotes to represent a string. It doesn't matter which you use, just make sure they match. `"valid" 'valid' "invalid'`. You can also use backticks for string ` but we'll get to that in a second.
* You can concatenate strings in javascript the same way you do in Swift, by using `+`, or by string interpolation. 
* String Interpolation in Javascript works the same way as it does not in Swift, but the syntax is a little different. Your entire string has to be enclosed in backticks `` ` `` and your variable has to be wrapped inside `${variable}`.


*Swift:*

```swift
let greeting = "Hello"
let name = "Sam"

print(greeting + " " + name) // Hello Sam
print("\(greeting) \(name)") // Hello Sam
```

*Javascript:*

```js
const greeting = "Hello"
const name = "Sam"

console.log(greeting + " " + name) // Hello Sam
console.log(`${greeting} ${name}`) // Hello Sam
```


### String methods

You can find a list of string methods and properties [here](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_string.asp). But you can basically achieve anything in Javascript that you can in Swift.

*Swift 3:*

```swift
let greeting = "Hello"

greeting.characters.count // 5
greeting.lowercased() // hello
```

*Javascript:*

```js
const greeting = "Hello"

greeting.length // 5
greeting.toLowerCase() // hello
```

> Note: In swift 4 we get the length of the string by calling `string.count` directly.

## Objects (Dictionaries)

JavaScript objects can be thought of as simple collections of name-value pairs, so they are more similar to dictionaries in Objective-C and Swift. Or tuples in Swift.

```js
{
	key: value,
	anotherKey: anotherValue
};
```

> Note: Remember that JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. Also remember that we convert JSON to a dictionary before we use the data in our iOS apps.

Create an empty object:

```js
const myObject = {};
```

Create an object with some default values:

```js
const dog = {
  name: "Fluffy",
  age: 7
};
```

An object's properties can again be accessed in one of two ways:

```js
dog["name"]; // Like a dictionary in Swift
dog.age; // Like an object in Swift

dog.home = "Lighthouse Labs";
dog["age"] = 8;
```

> Note: let and const are only for assignment, all objects in javascript are mutable.

The key part of the object is a JavaScript string, while the value can be any JavaScript value — including more objects. This allows you to build data structures of arbitrary complexity:

```js
const dog = {
  name: "Fluffy",
  age: 7,
  owner: {
  	name: "Larry",
  	pets: ["Fluffy", "George"]
  }
};
```


## Arrays

Arrays in JavaScript are actually a special type of object. They work very much like regular objects (numerical properties can naturally be accessed only using [] syntax) but they have one magic property called 'length'. This is always one more than the highest index in the array.

Create an empty array:

```js
const myArray = [];
```

Create an array with some default values:

```js
const animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'hen'];
```

Access an array:

```js
const totalAnimals = animals.length; // 3
const first = animals[0]; // dog
const last = animals[animals.length - 1]; // hen
const position = animals.indexOf('cat'); // 1
```

Modify an array:

```js
animals.push('duck'); // [ 'dog', 'cat', 'hen', 'duck' ]
animals.unshift('donkey'); // [ 'donkey', 'dog', 'cat', 'hen', 'duck' ]
const duck = animals.pop; // [ 'donkey', 'dog', 'cat', 'hen' ]
const donkey = animals.shift; // [ 'dog', 'cat', 'hen' ]
```

## Control Structures if, while, for, & switch

Control structures in Javascript are very similar to Swift & Objective-C

```js
const name = 'kittens';
if (name == 'puppies') {
  name += ' woof';
} else if (name == 'kittens') {
  name += ' meow';
} else {
  name += '!';
}
name == 'kittens meow';
```

```js
while (true) {
  // an infinite loop!
}
```

```
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  // Will execute 5 times
}
```

```js
for (let value of array) {
  // do something with value
}
```

```js
for (let property in object) {
  // do something with object property
}
```

```js
switch (action) {
  case 'draw':
    drawIt();
    break;
  case 'eat':
    eatIt();
    break;
  default:
    doNothing();
}
```

## Operators and Equality

Operators in Javascript are pretty much the same as they are in Swift:

`+ - * / =`

`==` is different though. When you use the double equals, javascript compares two values for equality after converting both values to a common type:

```js
123 == '123'; // true
1 == true; // true
```

In this code, `'123'` and `true` will get converted to numbers before being compared. To avoid type coercion, use the triple-equals operator:

```js
123 === '123'; // false
1 === true;    // false
123 === 123    // true
```

> Note: There are also != and !== operators.

## Semicolons

Notice that we are using semicolons in all of the Javascript example. Semicolons are not required in Javascript, but unlike swift, it's good practice to always add a semicolon. 

## Functions

Functions in Javascript are very similar to functions in Swift. You can create functions in javascript using the `function` keyword. 

```js
function greet() {
    console.log("hello")
}

greet() // call the greet function
```

Functions can take parameters and return values. The main difference between swift and javascript is that you don't specify any types in javascript.

*Swift:*

```swift
func welcome(name: String, day: Int) -> String {
    return "Hello \(name), today is the \(day)th."
}

let result = welcome("Anna", day: 11); 
```

*Javascript:*

```js
function welcome(name, day)  {
    return "Hello \(name), today is the \(day)th."
}

const result = welcome("Anna", 11); 
```

## Anonymous Functions

In Swift, we call unnamed functions closures. Or the inverse, functions are closures with a name. 

```swift
let wordPrinterClosure = { (word:String)->(Void) in
    print("\(word)")
}
```

In Javascript we just call these anonymous functions and we can declare them using either of the following two syntaxes:

```js
const wordPrinterClosure = function(word) {
    console.log("\(word)");
}
```
```js
const wordPrinterClosure = (word) => {
    console.log("\(word)");
}
```

The second of these two examples, known as a fat arrow function, is the prefered way of declaring an anonymous function.

Both Swift and Javascript allow higher order functions, functions that accept another function as a parameter. This is where we most commonly see uses of anonymous functions. Here's an example of using map on an array of numbers in both languages:

*Swift:*

```swift
let numbers = [10, 7, 28, 9, 83, 73, 65, 2, 39]

let numbersMultipliedByThree = numbers.map( { (number: Int) -> Int in
    return number * 3
})

print(numbersMultipliedByThree)
```

*Javascript:*

```js
const numbers = [10, 7, 28, 9, 83, 73, 65, 2, 39];

const numbersMultipliedByThree = numbers.map( (number) => {
    return number * 3
});

console.log(numbersMultipliedByThree);
```

Both languages also have shorthand syntaxes when using their anonymous functions:

*Swift:*

```swift
numbers.map { number in number * 3 }
```

*Javascript:*

```swift
numbers.map( number => number * 3 );
```
